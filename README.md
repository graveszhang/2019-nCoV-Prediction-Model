## 2019-nCoV-Prediction-Model
A transmission model to reported case information up to 26 January to predict the possible course of the epidemic, as the potential impact of travel restrictions into and from Wuhan.

## Model Selection
The epidemic model is a way of simplifications of the reality, which helps refine our understanding about the logic of diffusion beneath social realities (disease transmission, information diffusion through networks, and adoption of new technologies or behaviors). 

Up to 27 January, since there are over 3000 confirmed 2019 n-CoV cases globally, with less than 1% of cure rate, we choose the SI (Susceptible and Infectious) model to apply in the prediction model.

We consider a “closed population” scenario with no births, deaths, or migrations, and assume the mixing is homogeneous.
