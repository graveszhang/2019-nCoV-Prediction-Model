## Introduction
A transimission model based on reported cases of 2019-nCoV within 1.12 and 1.26 to predict the possible course of the epidemic, as the potential impact of travel restrictions into and from Wuhan.

## SIR
The epidemic model is a way of simplifications of the reality, which helps refine our understanding about the logic of diffusion beneath social realities (disease transmission, information diffusion through networks, and adoption of new technologies or behaviors). 

Up to 27 January, since there are over 3000 confirmed 2019 n-CoV cases globally with growing cure rate, we choose the SIR (Susceptible - Infectious - Recovered) model to apply in the prediction model.

## Data & Visualization
- Source
  - API provided by CxZMoE: https://github.com/CxZMoE/nCoV (1.26 and before)
  - API provided by TankNee: https://github.com/TankNee/nCoV-2019-DataAPI (1.29 and before)

- Geographical distribution of 2019-nCoV in China for the data up to 26 January. (Wuhan province has over 1423 confirmed cases by 27 January, for better overall visualization we leave it blank for now.)

## Results
We estimate that the basic reproduction number of the infection(R0) to be 0.98, given by the transmissoin rate and recover rate set to be 0.781 and 0.795 respectively. We predict that the epidemic in Wuhan will be substantially larger by 100 days from now (24354 infections). The results is illustrated below.
